        <p className="mb-4">
          Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an unpredictable disease of the central nervous system that disrupts the flow of
          information within the brain, and between the brain and body.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The cause of MS is still unknown â€“ scientists believe the disease is triggered by an unidentified
          environmental factor in a person who is genetically predisposed to respond.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted. Most people with
          MS are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, with at least two to three times more women than men being
          diagnosed with the disease.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">MS Symptoms</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          MS symptoms are variable and unpredictable. No two people have exactly the same symptoms, and each person's
          symptoms can change or fluctuate over time.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Common symptoms include fatigue, walking difficulties, numbness or tingling, spasticity, weakness, vision
          problems, dizziness, bladder problems, cognitive changes, emotional changes, and pain.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">MS Treatments</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          While there is not yet a cure for MS, there are treatments that can help modify the course of the disease and
          manage symptoms.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Disease-modifying therapies may reduce disease activity and progression for many individuals with relapsing
          forms of MS, including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting MS, and active secondary progressive
          MS.
