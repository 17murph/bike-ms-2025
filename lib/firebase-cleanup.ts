/*
Firebase has been completely removed from the project.

The following changes were made:
1. Removed Firebase initialization code
2. Removed Firebase authentication references
3. Removed any Firebase database/Firestore references
4. Removed Firebase storage references
5. Removed Firebase cloud functions calls
6. Removed Firebase environment variables usage

The error "Cannot destructure property 'auth' of 'e' as it is undefined"
was caused by a component trying to access Firebase authentication
during server-side rendering.
